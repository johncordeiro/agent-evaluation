# Weni Agents

Weni is an intelligent agent platform that enables conversational AI experiences. This target allows you to test Weni agents through their API and WebSocket interface.

## Prerequisites

!!! warning "Important"
    You need both AWS and Weni credentials to run evaluations!

To use the Weni target, you need:

1. **AWS Credentials**: Required for the evaluator (Claude model via Bedrock)
   - AWS Access Key ID
   - AWS Secret Access Key
   - AWS Session Token

2. **A Weni Project**: An active project in the [Weni platform](https://weni.ai)

3. **Weni Authentication**: Choose one of the following methods:

   **üöÄ Option 1: Weni CLI (Recommended)**
   
   Install and authenticate with the Weni CLI:
   ```bash
   # Install Weni CLI
   pip install weni-cli
   
   # Authenticate with Weni
   weni login
   
   # Select your project
   weni project use [your-project-uuid]
   ```
   
   Get the Weni CLI from: https://github.com/weni-ai/weni-cli
   
   **üìã Option 2: Environment Variables**
   
   Set these environment variables manually:
   - `WENI_PROJECT_UUID`: Your project's unique identifier
   - `WENI_BEARER_TOKEN`: Your authentication bearer token
   
   **‚öôÔ∏è Option 3: Configuration File**
   
   Provide credentials directly in your test configuration file.

## Installation

The Weni target is included with the main package:

```bash
pip install weni-agenteval
```

The required `websocket-client` package is automatically installed as a dependency.

## Configuration

```yaml title="agenteval.yml"
target:
  type: weni
  language: pt-BR  # Optional, defaults to pt-BR
  timeout: 30      # Optional, max seconds to wait for response
  # Optionally provide credentials directly (not recommended):
  # weni_project_uuid: your-project-uuid
  # weni_bearer_token: your-bearer-token
```

### Parameters

`weni_project_uuid` *(string; optional)*

The unique identifier of your Weni project. If not provided, the target will look for the `WENI_PROJECT_UUID` environment variable.

```yaml
weni_project_uuid: 45718786-4066-4338-9e86-f3ea525224d2
```

---

`weni_bearer_token` *(string; optional)*

The bearer token for authenticating with the Weni API. If not provided, the target will look for the `WENI_BEARER_TOKEN` environment variable.

```yaml
weni_bearer_token: your-bearer-token-here
```

---

`language` *(string; optional)*

The language code for the conversation. This affects how the agent processes and responds to messages. Defaults to `"pt-BR"`.

Common language codes:
- `pt-BR`: Brazilian Portuguese (default)
- `en-US`: American English
- `es`: Spanish
- `fr`: French

```yaml
language: en-US
```

---

`timeout` *(integer; optional)*

Maximum time in seconds to wait for the agent's response via WebSocket. Defaults to `30`.

```yaml
timeout: 45
```

## How It Works

The Weni target interacts with Weni agents through a two-step process:

1. **Message Sending**: Sends the user prompt to the Weni API via HTTP POST request
2. **Response Reception**: Connects to a WebSocket endpoint to receive the agent's asynchronous response

Each test case uses a unique contact identifier (`contact_urn`) to maintain conversation isolation and history throughout the test session.

## Example Test Plan

```yaml title="weni_test_plan.yml"
evaluator:
  model: claude-3

target:
  type: weni
  language: pt-BR
  timeout: 30

tests:
  greeting:
    steps:
      - Send a greeting "Ol√°, bom dia!"
    expected_results:
      - Agent responds with a friendly greeting
      - Agent introduces itself or explains its capabilities

  product_inquiry:
    steps:
      - Ask "Quais produtos voc√™s t√™m dispon√≠veis?"
    expected_results:
      - Agent provides information about available products
      - Response includes clear product descriptions or categories

  multi_turn_conversation:
    steps:
      - Ask "Qual √© o hor√°rio de funcionamento?"
      - Follow up with "E aos finais de semana?"
    expected_results:
      - Agent provides business hours for weekdays
      - Agent maintains context and provides weekend hours
      - Responses are coherent and contextual

  help_request:
    steps:
      - Say "Preciso de ajuda com um problema"
    expected_results:
      - Agent offers assistance
      - Agent asks clarifying questions about the problem
      - Response is empathetic and helpful

  error_handling:
    steps:
      - Send an unclear message "xyz123 !!!"
    expected_results:
      - Agent handles the unclear input gracefully
      - Agent asks for clarification or provides guidance
      - No error messages are exposed to the user
```

## Running Tests

### Using Weni CLI (Recommended)

If you're using the Weni CLI for authentication:

```bash
weni-agenteval run
```

The tool automatically looks for `agenteval.yml` in the current directory.

### Using Environment Variables

```bash
export WENI_PROJECT_UUID="your-project-uuid"
export WENI_BEARER_TOKEN="your-bearer-token"
weni-agenteval run
```

### Additional CLI Options

```bash
# Run with verbose output
weni-agenteval run --verbose

# Run specific tests only
weni-agenteval run --filter "greeting,purchase_outside_postal_code"

# Run from a different directory
weni-agenteval run --plan-dir /path/to/test/directory

# Initialize a new test plan template
weni-agenteval init
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**AWS Authentication Errors**
- Verify your AWS environment variables are set correctly (ACCESS_KEY_ID, SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, SESSION_TOKEN)
- Ensure you have access to Amazon Bedrock in your specified region
- Check that your AWS credentials have the necessary Bedrock permissions
- Verify the `aws_region` in your configuration matches your AWS account's region access

**Weni Authentication Errors**
- **Using Weni CLI (Recommended)**: Run `weni login` to re-authenticate, then `weni project use [project-uuid]` to select your project
- **Using Environment Variables**: Verify your `WENI_BEARER_TOKEN` is valid and not expired
- Check that the `WENI_PROJECT_UUID` matches your actual project
- Ensure the bearer token has the necessary permissions for the project
- Get Weni CLI at: https://github.com/weni-ai/weni-cli

**Connection Issues**
- Verify the Weni API endpoints are accessible from your network
- Check for any firewall or proxy settings blocking HTTPS/WSS connections
- Ensure your internet connection is stable

**Timeout Errors**
- Increase the `timeout` parameter if your agent requires more processing time
- Check if the agent is properly configured and active in the Weni platform
- Verify the agent is not stuck in a processing loop

**WebSocket Connection Failures**
- Ensure the `websocket-client` package is properly installed
- Check for any proxy configurations that might interfere with WebSocket connections
- Verify the WebSocket endpoint URL is correct for your project

### Debug Logging

To enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

This will show detailed information about:
- API request/response details
- WebSocket connection status
- Message processing steps
- Error details

## Limitations

- Each test case maintains its own conversation context through a unique contact identifier
- The target waits for the `finalResponse` message type and ignores intermediate processing messages
- Response time depends on the agent's complexity and the Weni platform's processing time
